# Danielsaurus. Rawr?
Made with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted with Github Pages. Site design/template modified from [an original design by Micah](http://getmicah.github.io) and inspired by [Kilm](http://kilmc.com/) and [Kottke](http://kottke.org), who are awesome. Many thanks to them â€” especially since I was having serious designer's block, and needed a jumping off point (hey, I'm not proud of it). More stuff on the way soon(-ish).
